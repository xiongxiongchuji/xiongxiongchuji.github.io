I'm a third year undergraduate student from [College of Electronic and Information Engineering](https://ceie.szu.edu.cn/), [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/).

I am interested in various topics related to artificial intelligence and computer vision, such as low-level vision tasks, medical image processing, object detection, and weakly supervised learning. My current research focuses on ***Diffusion-Based Image Super-Resolution, medical imaging and Underwater Object Detection***
